## Franklin County Inmate and COVID-19 Scraper

### What is this?
This is a Node.js library to serve as an interface for scraping data from the [Franklin County Sheriff's Inmate Booking Search](https://fcsojmsweb.franklincountyohio.gov/Publicview/BookingFind.aspx), as
well as the [COVID-19 CSV dataset](https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/static/COVIDSummaryData.csv)
providedby the state of Ohio.

It is to facilitate tracking the count of inmates in Franklin County's jails in the midst of the
COVID-19 outbreak.

### How can I use it?
Wait until it's done, then I'll explain more, I promise! Until then, figure it out, or if you want
you can bug me personally. This project shouldn't get too complex, though, so it shouldn't be too
terrible to figure out.

### I'm from the State of Ohio/Franklin County Sheriff's Department, stop using our data!
Okay! Email me at [jacob@jacobpa.com](jacob@jacobpa.com), and I'll be happy to destroy this project.
